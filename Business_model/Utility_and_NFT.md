TEA project builds a T-rust platform on which every TEA node can run trusted computing tasks for client. In return the client pays fiat or any stable crypto that can convert to fiat to the involved tea nodes (Executor, Delegator, Verifier etc). The revenue goes to the TEA node's owner (so called benefitier).
