# Keep competition healthy
Keep an ideal ratio between nodes and tasks is very important to create a healthy competition. If the ratio is too low, all nodes make less profit and less client satisfaction. If the ratio is too high, an individual node will make less profit and waste of investment. 
Since the death of TEA nodes is out of control, the only way to automatically adjust the ratio is birth control. Layer one smart contracts carefully calculate how many new TEA nodes are allowed to join the network at a given period. The birth ratio is not fixed but adjusted by smart contracts every few hundreds of blocks based on the average length of the task queue. The calculation algorithm can be updated by the governance too.

When there are more TEA nodes want to join the network, but the headcount is limited by birth control, an auction takes place. 

The income from the auction goes to the [public service](Public_services.md) funding pool.
