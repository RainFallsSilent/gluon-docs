# Double loops: Segregation between crypto andÂ fiat
![Double loops](../res/double_loops.png)


Investors pay crypto (such BTC) to invest an NFT (Non-fungible token). Every NFT ties to a physical mining machine. This mining machine joins the T-rust to running trusted computing services to clients who pay fiat as service charge. The fiat revenue returns to the investor as ROI (Returns on invest).

NFT's values are the profitability of the mining machine. Every mining machine is unique. Its credit history and performance history determine how much revenue it can generate. The investor can sell the NFT for crypto in TEA exchange for capital gain if the value goes up.

The NFT can be sold in whole or in shares. This is called Trust Securitization. That means you can buy a share of a profitable NFT as if it is a stock of a company.

Buy and sell an NFT doesn't need to physically relocate the mining machine. It is still where it was. Just the ownership and profit account directly to the new owner.

This is a new way to invest your crypto while earning fiat legally. This business model is exactly the opposite of Bitcoin mining, which spend fiat to buy machines and pay utility then min crypto as revenue. Bitcoin machines depreciate very fast but T-rust mining NFT is supposed to increase in value because of the credit gains over time.
