# TEA stands for Trusted Execution and Attestation
[Internet is broken](Broken_internet_needs_a_fix.md), TEA is trying to [fix](How_TEA_fix_internet.md) it. TEA is developing a [dApp](https://medium.com/@pushbar/how-do-i-define-dapps-1a3600b49e2f) platform (T-rust) based on many modern technologies, such as [IPFS](TEA_vs_IPFS.md), [Blockchain](TEA_vs_blockchain.md), [Trusted computing](TEA_vs_Trusted_computing.md) and [Web assembly](TEA_vs_wasm.md). Developers can [use existing cloud-app experiences to build T-rust dApps](Fill_the_gap.md) with minimal changes.

## TEA vs T-rust

TEA is the name of the project: TEA Project. TEA is also pronounced “T” as the initial of the word “Trust”.
T-rust is the name of the platform TEA project builds to run dApps. So far T-rust is the only product TEA project is working on. So sometime we use TEA and T-rust interchangably. Trust can be broken down to T and rust. Rust is the main programming language we used in our project (another two minors are Golang and Javascript). So Trust can be T-rust or Tea-Rust. This is how I give our project such a fancy name. 
## Our logo

Since it is called “tea”, the logo should be tea-related. So a cup of tea is my first idea.

In the beginning, I did not put the teabag in the logo. So you can't tell it is a cup of coffee or tea. Both of them are hot drinks. In order to distinguish from coffee, I added a teabag.
Well, it looks like a cup of tea now. But it is just a cup of tea. Nothing to do with hardware protected security. I move one step further. Now the teabag runs into a computer chip with a “lock” logo on it.

I asked my designer friend Nick to put all of those elements together. Bang! we got it!

## How did the TEA idea come from?

I wrote in my [sweeping monk blog](https://medium.com/@pushbar) about the history of the TEA idea in [English](https://medium.com/@pushbar/0-of-n-cover-letter-of-the-trusted-webassembly-runtime-on-ipfs-12a4fd8c4338) and [Chinese](https://medium.com/@pushbar/%E7%AC%AC0%E7%AF%87-%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2%E6%B8%8A%E6%BA%90%E5%92%8C%E6%8E%A2%E7%B4%A2%E8%BF%87%E7%A8%8B%E7%9A%84%E5%BF%AB%E8%BF%9B%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC-ecbb558ac36e). At the time when that blog was written I have not use the name "TEA". I just call it "Trusted WebAssembly Runtime on IPFS", which is too long and too technical. Soon after, I use the name "TEA" starting from my another blog post [Zen of TEA](https://medium.com/@pushbar/zen-of-tea-1-2480c8c249c3). Please click the link and read. It helps you understand the background of TEA project.
